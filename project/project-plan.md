# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Relation between climate change and immigration
## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Does climate change have an affect on immigration in countries that are vulnerable to climate change?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
As the climate change is seen the biggest problem of today's world, one other topic that make people concern is immigration. 
 In this project we will examine the temperature and immigration datasets to find if there is a relation between two. I have monthly average temperatures of countries for 2013 and before, and global asylum movements between 2000 and 2020. That's why I will focus on the years between 2000 and 2013.
 Aim of the project is to provide insights, with which decision makers can take the necessary steps.
## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?select=GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv
* Data Type: CSV

This datasets shows monthly average temperatures of the countries and consists of four columns.
  First column shows the date between 1743 and 2013.
  Second column shoes the average temperature.
  Third column shows the average temperature uncertainity. (the 95% confidence interval around the average)
  Last column shows the country that the measurements belong to.

### Datasource1: Global Asylum Data (2000 - 2020)
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrasaurabh/global-asylum-data-2000-present
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrasaurabh/global-asylum-data-2000-present?select=asylum-applications.csv
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset contains, the countries involved, applications for refuge and the decisions taken by world leading countries to help the people in need. We have the data for the years between 2000 and 2020.
